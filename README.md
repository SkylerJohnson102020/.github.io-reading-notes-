# Welcome to Skyler Johnson's new GitHub Page!!!!!

## About Me
My name is **Skyler Johnson**, and at 37 years of age, I decided due to the COVID-19 pandemic to take a new path toward programming. This was a long and difficult decision to make, but ultimately what made this the right choice was considering my family and how heavily the pandemic has had an impact on my current field. For the last 20 years, I have pursued a career in music playing in several symphony orchestras and teaching at multiple universites. Currently, I am the bass trombonist of the Spokane Symphony Orchestra and faculty at Whitworth University. I am living in Spokane with my wife, Heather, and my 4 month old son, Jonah.

## My Growth Mindset
My growth mindest stems directly from my training as a classical musician. As a performance major, you have weekly one-on-one lessons with your professor who specializes in the instrument that you are trying to improve. There is no room for arrogance, backtalk, or contradicting anything that your professor tells you, so you learn quite quickly to be swift to listen and slow to speak. Based on how well you prepare for your lesson, the tone can be supportive, positive, frustrating, negative, or even crushing. In my own personal growth, the lessons where I learned the most were the ones where my spirit was absolutely crushed. One might think an experience like this may destroy any remaining desire to continue pursuing this career, let alone the next lesson, but these experiences helped me to take a step back, analyze my situation, and strive to do better the next lesson. Whether it be in a lesson, rehearsing with an ensemble, or practicing by yourself, you are always thinking about how you can make your craft better. In rehearsal, it is very easy to blame others musicians for the problems that you encounter. From my standpoint, I adhere to the age old saying, "If you point the finger at someone, just realize that you have three pointing right back at you." 

**My growth mindset includes:**
- Always figuring out a way to where I can do my job better.
- How can I perform better to help my colleagues.
- If I encounter a problem, I will use all of my tools and training to help me work through to learn how to perform a task.
- Always be open and willing to ask for help when necessary.
- If you are curious about a complex subject, don't be afraid to speak up and be willing to discuss with superiors and colleagues.

## Applying My Growth Mindset to Other Facets of Life
I apply my growth mindset to many other things then just my work life. This applies to spending time with my son and helping him grow, working on my house, exercising and nutrition. One of my instructors in Chicago is the bass tromboinst of the Chicago Symphony, Charles Vernon. Just to give some context, this man is better than ever at his craft and in peak physical condition in his early 70s. In his late 60s and early 70s, this man has earned a black belt in Tae Kwon Do, swam one of the channels in the Great Lakes, and beat diabetes dropping 40 pounds in 3 months. 

In his own words:
> _"I have to keep doing it in order to **KEEP DOING IT!!!**"_
